## Final Project Reflection

#### Q1: What was the most proud moment for you during this project?
- Figuring out how to display database extracted information on a Kivy screen. Although I wasn't fond of the layout of my homescreen, I was happy that I had found a way to extract and display the data corresponding to the discounts available.
  
#### Q2: What worked well this project?
- I think I work well with SQL integration and databases. Once I got my discount screen working, everything else flowed and was easy to reimplement and adjust for whatever the section recquired.

#### Q3: What will I do differently for P4 and the IA? 
- For Criteria A, I will make sure to mention the issues tackled when developing my success criteria
- For my record of tasks, I will generalise my taks less. Instead of using blanket statements, I will specify what exactly I am working on, and stating it's relevance to the project, as well as stating the section of the development cycle it corresponds with. E.g. Development: Coding verify_user for LoginScreen.
- For my test plan, I will have one test per success criteria rather than multiple tests relating to a single criteria
- I will set checkpoints in the development process where I will go back to Dr. Ruben and make sure all of my documentation is up to date. Although I was updating certain elements semi-frequently, I'd often let it pile up and as such, complete some components subparly. If I had set self-check days where I can sit down properly and update my documentation, and get it checked soon afterwards, I will be able to ensure my documentation's final product does not come out sloppy or poor in quality.
- As I complete certain 

#### Q4: What are 3 (or more) things I need help with?
- I need help finding justifications for using certain tools in my development. I find it difficult to justify using Python or other coding techniques we learn in class when it comes to projects when it's a requirement for me to use them. In the end, I resort to using blanket statements that could apply to theoretically any other programming language or concept.
