# Unit 3: Manaka Enterprises

## Criteria A: Planning

### Problem Definition

My client, a representative of a public firm called Manaka Enterprises, is dedicated to reducing food waste in their local town. As of late, they’ve noticed a rise in leftover food that is being discarded by local food establishments (e.g. restaurants) has hit a peak it has never had in years. In addition to the food wastage, the current system in place has proven itself to constantly be ineffective. Workers from the firm are dispatched across the town to collect leftover statistics from the restaurant owners at the end of the day, causing worker exhaustion as this has to be done daily. On top of that the company’s budget deficit has grown as the amount of capital required to pay for all the data collection costs builds up quickly due to inefficiencies in the system. Frustrated with current operations, the firm has agreed with all involved restaurants to put in measures to allow for discount pricing past 4 pm each day on leftover dishes. However, this hasn’t been as effective as they had hoped, as due to being based in a tourist town, most large scale advertisements are only partially effective as people enter and leave the city on a frequent basis. 

### Proposed Solution

In order to resolve their issues, I propose to create an application called FoodFinder. The application will cater to three different types of users; consumers, restaurants, and sustainability staff at Manaka Enterprises. On this app, users will be able to browse through the discount menus at various restaurants in the town. Restaurants owners and staff will be able to publicly release and advertise discounts they are offering on certain meals at their respective restaurants. The staff at Manaka Enterprise will be able to observe the trends at each restaurant and see if wastage has dropped due to data inputted by both the restaurants and the purchases tracked and collected within the app.

### Success Criteria

In order for this application to prove successful the application must be able to accomplish the following:
The system includes a login interface that allows authorized personnel at Manaka Enterprises to access data related to each restaurant’s leftover statistics.
The system includes a search algorithm that enables users to find discounts, with filtering options based on:
Location
Price range
Food category (e.g., cuisine type or meal type)
The system provides a login interface for restaurant staff to post and remove discounts on food items sold at their establishment.
The system ensures that all password and login data portraying to the businesses is properly encrypted.
